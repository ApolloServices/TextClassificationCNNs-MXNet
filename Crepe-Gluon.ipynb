      "Cast Iron and SuperSaver Shipping = Woo Hoo! | I have had a couple of cast iron skillets prior to purchasing this Dutch Oven from Amazon. This Oven is great. I use it for stews and beans and sourdough bread and all sorts of things.Because I will use this in the oven rather than over a campfire, the  handles on the side of the Dutch Oven work much better that the wire bail handle. The picture may have the wire hadle. This isn't that pot.I use this as my crockpot replacement. Don't need one with this around. That's just  my $.02, others will say that both are so cheap that you could get a crockpot too, and it would still be much cheaper than Le Crueset.It's cast iron. You know how good that is. The only thing I don't make in it are tomato sauces and other things that would not be so great with a reactive vessel. In several years, when the seasoning is rock hard, even that might not be a problem.Amazon has a great price and super saver shipping on cast iron. Read that again. Free shipping on cast iron. When I got the packing list, the shipping alone would have been about $13.00, ground.Many comments here about the seasoning - both good and bad. Having had cast iron before, I washed it and reseasoned it by oiling it and baking it upside down for an hour or so at 350 degrees (F) before using it the first time. I also stuck my other cast iron pieces in there at the same time. Why not? Worked great. No sticking at all.I reseason my stuff 1 - 2 times a year, at least. It's just part of maintaning the stuff. I will probably do the new dutch oven more often than that for the first several years to get it to the same point where the other pans are a bit faster.\n",

      "Amazing Grace | Fantastic book!  I was surprised how little I knew about the history of the slave trade.  The depravity that allowed such an abomination to continue so long for profit is simply shocking. We tend to think of slavery as exclusive to the American south.  In fact, Europe shares the burden of guilt for this horror. England in the mid to late 1700's was not the prim and proper gentrified place of our imaginations.  Slavery was but one example of the ugly, evil affairs of the time. Self absorbed cruelty was the common condition. Yet goodness bloomed and struggled mightily against the darkness in the person of William Wilberforce. Wilberforce's story and struggles along with those of the like-minded men and women who worked with him is astounding and uplifting.  We take for granted many of the social changes that came about through their efforts.  Eric Metaxas has captured the heart and soul of the times and beautifully tells the tale of the man whose faith and conscience brought an end to the slave trade.  We must not remain in the dark about this history. Eric Metaxas has brought us a profound and important story in a page turning, entertaining, soul-stirring book. Read it!\n",

      "An Exceptional Movie, Can't Wait for the Signature DVD!! | I first saw this film in Scottsdale, AZ at the local arthouse movie theatre, and it really left me with a feeling. Couldn't immediately put it into words or identify it, but a feeling nonetheless...an impact...a strange sensation. The more time that passed, the more I thought about the film and the more I liked the experiece while watching it. Although I have never been to HK, I believe that Wayne Wang has captured the breath and soul of Hong Kong and the mysteries that it carries. It has put in me, a hope and a dream that one day I can visit this exotic city and breathe in the aroma, the sounds and sights of its vibrant, pulsing atmosphere. Even with Ms. Li's newly budding English skills, this is still a remarkable piece and dazzles with metaphors and rich character-driven fabric. Ruben Blades is a marvelous choice as Iron's ex-pat friend and strums a beautiful song, Across the Borderline. Mr. Wang, if you are listening, this is fine piece of work and I hope that you continue to make these wonderful films that evoke a canvas of feelings and stimulate the senses.\n",

      "Cat tells it like it is! | One major reason to buy this album is that is is the closest you can come to owning a \"Harold and Maude\" soundtrack.  But there is so much more of value here than those songs, though they are among the best on the album in my opinion. I feel that this is a worthy introduction to Stevens' music, despite the omission of a few key songs. Unfortunately it also chronicles a shift in Stevens' style from the more folksy, heartfelt tunes of his early years to the more slicky produced, synthsized sounds of his later career. Obviously I belong to the subgroup of Stevens fans who feel that his earlier work was far superior; I regard some of the later songs on this disc as curiosity pieces to show what '70s-style production could do to even the most capable of musicians.There are many gems worth hearing here, though. The classic \"Father and Son\", still applicable today; \"If You Want To Sing Out, Sing Out\", an embracing of a Zen-like philosophy too seldom seen today; \"On the Road to Find Out\", which somehow can make a spiritual seeker like me (or you) realize that being on the path is the best place to be and not to rush toward the end. Cat Stevens may not employ the haunting imagery of a Leonard Cohen or the pervasive atmospherics of a Tom Waits, but he can still write deeply affecting songs with the best of them. The simplicity of his tunes gives them the appeal of modern haikus, and his voice seems to say that he means every word. There are some who prefer to wallow in their miseries and misfortunes, surrounding themselves with dark influences at times when their lives are equally black. If you're one of those, don't purchase this CD. But if you prefer to look up at the stars when you're lying in a gutter, buy this CD (or any others Cat Stevens has made) the next time you're feeling down. Put it in your car and drive to the nearest empty field you know. Bring a bottle of wine or an ice-cream cone. Park in that field, sit on the ground, and let the music play from your open car doors. Loudly. And then you'll know what Cat knows. Everything is going to be all right.\n",

      "A Christ for \"our times\" | This is the most publicized version of all the  motion pictures that portray Jesus. In this case, \"the crucifixtion\". The media, through commentary and reviews, have exhausted the headlines. Critics have traversed from a \"devout rendition\" to a \"magnanimous publicity stunt\", with Mr. Gibson taking it head on.It is a tremendous film and an absolute \"must see\". Yes, it is violent. Years ago, in a film showing Christ, we never saw His face. Then it was a young and energetic Jeffrey Hunter. A mature and intense Max von Sydow. And so on. Now Mel Gibson gives us Jim Caviezel as a bloody and suffering man or Messiah. The choice is yours as you view this film. But this contemporary portrait is a sign of our times. Perhaps a retrospective on what we have become.The production with its originality of concept works well. You would'nt think a film with no english dialogue could hold your attention. A cast of relatively unknown actors do a superb job. The soundtrack is both eerie and penetrating. Elements of violence are not arbitrary but well thought out.The film is edited for a trim 2 hours and should be seen by both \"believer\" and \"non-believer\". Just so you can form your own opinion, because that's the only one that counts.\n",

      "RUSH is at the top of their game with this masterpiece | Moving Pictures was the first RUSH cd that I ever purchased. It's tied for #1 as my favorite with Permanent Waves and 2112. The one drawback about this remastered cd, is that when I play this remaster with my original issue, the remastered cd sounds about the same. I don't understand why they remaster cd's if there is no improvement in the sound quality.The remaster is not bad sounding it just isn't any better. As for the quality of the tracks of Moving Pictures every song is a 10 on a scale of 1-10. Even though TOM SAWYER is a great song, I've heard it one too many times on the radio. YYZ is one of the great instrumentals in rock history. I absolutely love THE CAMERA EYE. I love their really long song's like that.I think VITAL SIGNS should have been put out as a single, it's really cool. Of course last but not least RED BARCHETTA, and LIMELIGHT are absolute classics. If your not sure which RUSH cd to start with, I would suggest \"MOVING PICTURES\", \"PERMANENT WAVES\", or \"2112\".\n",

      "Does what other molds can't! | If you are looking for a mold that works this one is the answer you have been searching for. Plastic molds I have used in the past stick and eventually break. These molds have outlasted all their predecessors and done a perfect job every time. These units are more expensive but they last so much longer it is well worth it. This mold is also flexible so you can push the candies out of the mold if they get stuck. No need to grease or lubricate, silicone is the perfect answer.\n",

      "A plot that includes such horrible events, that they are almost comedic | The story takes place in an upscale rental unit, in the vicinity of the front yard, and occasionally in other settings, such as in a hospital emergency room.  The rental unit is a tattered Victorian home that is located in Pacific Heights.  Pacific Heights is the most expensive part of San Francisco.  A young married couple (Matthew Modine and Melanie Griffith) decides to take out a loan and buy the old Victorian home.  They begin to screen potential renters, politely asking each party to fill out a form to confirm their finances.  As it turns out, one of the potential renters somehow moves into one of the two rental units and begins \"living\" there.  Then the troubles escalate.  The renter (Michael Keaton) never pays the rent or the security deposit.  Michael Keaton has a male roommate who is a non-communicative thug, who makes loud noises at all hours of the day, banging large holes in the walls.  The two roommates keep thousands of cockroaches, who meander free in the apartment.  The cockroaches find their way into the apartment of the neighboring tenants, who are polite middle-aged Japanese professionals.  In one scene, we see the cockroaches spilling out of a small hole under the sink, and meandering around the apt of the Japanese tenants.  In another scene, the Japanese man drives a nail in the wall, for use in hanging a picture, causing an electrical fire, and causing all the lights in the building to go out.  The young couple hires an attorney with the goal of evicting Michael Keaton, but the judge tells the couple that Michael Keaton has a right to continue occupying the apartment.  Things go from bad to worse, to very worse, and to much more worse.  As the story continues, the couple finds itself in deeper sushi.  Another movie, WHAT ABOUT BOB, is similar to this movie, but PACIFIC HEIGHTS is WHAT-ABOUT-BOB-on-steroids.  In WHAT ABOUT BOB, an unwanted houseguest makes himself at home, and the protagonist gets angrier and angrier and drives himself into a fit.  The same sort of thing happens to Matthew Modine in PACIFIC HEIGHTS, who is periodically driven over the edge by Michael Keaton's antics.The normally innocuous theme of PACIFIC HEIGHTS (the issue of evicting a bad tenant), contrasts with the developing horrors that beset the young couple. In a sort of perverted way, this contrast has a comedic effect, at least for the first 2/3rds of the movie.  A similar comedic effect occurs in a 20-minutes sketch by John Candy, called, ROY'S FOOD REPAIR.  What is innocuous in this sketch, is ordinary damage to food, such as a crushed portion of a birthday cake, or salt falling off from potato chips and accumulating at the bottom of the bag.  What is a developing cause of alarm, is the fact that John Candy charges money to repair birthday cakes, potato chips, and other types of food.  Sometimes, John Candy decides that the damage would cost too much to repair, and he refuses to help the client with his food.At about the two-thirds point in PACIFIC HEIGHTS, the film discontinues its flirtation with innocuous comedy.  At this two-thirds point, the film segues into a pathological crime-thriller, almost on par with FORT APACHE THE BRONX or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.\n",

      "5 Star album... though bittersweet with David Lee Roth exiting shortly there after... | THE BAND: Eddie Van Halen (guitars, keyboards), David Lee Roth (vocals), Michael Anthony (bass), Alex Van Halen (drums & percussion).THE DISC: (1984) 9 tracks clocking in at approximately 33 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page booklet containing song titles/credits/times and all original album artwork. Digitally remastered in 2000. Recorded at 5150 (Eddie Van Halen's home studio in Los Angeles, CA). This is the band's 6th studio album. Label - Warner Bros.COMMENTS: Looking back decades later, this album was bittersweet for me... probably for a lot of people. It was a great comeback from the lackluster \"Diver Down\" (1982). Most of the songs were heavy and the aggression was back. Eddie really cut loose with his guitar on \"1984\". And, a new twist - keyboards took center stage on two tracks (technically three tracks - the title track leading into and including \"Jump\", and \"I'll Wait\"), which turned out to be rather catchy songs. Both slick and melodic, leaning toward the commercial rock side - and garnering lots of time spent on the FM airwaves. \"Jump\" reached #1 on the Billboard charts, and \"I'll Wait\" reached #13. Two more hits came with \"Panama\" (also reaching #13) and \"Hot For Teacher\" (#56). The album itself reached #2 on Billboard's Hot 200 list for '84 (Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" was the only thing standing in the way of it reaching #1). \"1984\" reached the elite \"Diamond\" certified status (10+ million) in 1999. However successful \"1984\" was though...it would be David Lee Roth's last album with Van Halen. It would be the end of an era (enter the bitter part of \"bittersweet\"). Not a year has gone by since Roth left the band, that I haven't wished they could've stayed together for at least a few more albums. Lots of people say \"1984\" was too heavy on the keyboards. Perhaps this is so only because the band didn't use the keyboards much, and when they did use them, they were always in the background. Outside of \"Jump\" and \"I'll Wait\", the rest of the album jams with old school rock guitars - like the Eddie Van Halen we know from VH's 1st and 2nd albums. The other tracks not mentioned (\"House Of Pain\", \"Girls Gone Bad\", \"Drop Dead Legs\" and the catchy \"Top Jimmy\") were all fast and/or heavy tracks that made the album complete. Listen to the brilliant album closer \"House Of Pain\" - it's one long trademark Eddie Van Halen solo. Absolutely no filler on \"1984\". This would be Van Halen's last classic album (5 stars).\n",

      "A Labyrinth of Darkness Below and Between the Streets of London | I had heard of Neil Gaiman from a friend and finally decided to give his works a try, starting with Neverwhere. I found out from my local used bookseller that the television series came first and then the author wrote the book based upon the min-series.Neverwhere is a highly captivating story that takes place above and below the London streets. The story's protagonist, Richard Mayhew, unwittingly becomes involved in this underworld network after he helps a young girl, named Door, whom he found injured and bleeding in the London Underground. Richard's good samaritan deed plunges him into a darkly, disturbing world below the streets of London as to his dismay, he ceases to exist in the London above inasmuch as no one above remembers him. Soon Richard joins Door in a quest through the shadowy and dangerous London below to help her find who murdered her family.This wonderful novel has intrigue, mystery, and scary villains but it is the richly drawn characters that make this story exceptional. I found Gaiman's world to be fascinating, nightmarish, comic, and realistic. Very highly recommended.\n",

      "Solid Product | I purchased the Topeak Pocket Rocket Master Blaster (what a name, huh?!) from Amazon after reading reviews for a number of portable bike pumps available on the site. Upon initial inspection, it really looks like a well-constructed product. The aluminum body is quite light, seems durable and the silver color shouldn't have a problem coordinating with really any color scheme. The valve stem locking mechanism seems solid, too.The multiple valve options (Schraeder/Presta/Dunlop) definitely are a nice touch. I've just started getting into road biking - my gf picked me up a '73 Schwinn Varsity from a yard sale - and the tubes in it use Schraeder valves. I assume I'll upgrade bikes/wheels/tubes at some point along the road (no pun intended), and didn't want to have to needlessly spend money on a different pump if different tubes are purchased. You'll need to do some adjustments with the plastic bits inside the head to switch between the 3, but that didn't take more than a couple minutes of adjusting around to figure out.As other reviewers have stated, this isn't aimed at being your primary bike pump (the small canister obviously lacks the capacity of a standing pump or air compressor), but if you're out biking and get a flat, this works exactly as it should. The only feature I can think of that could make it better would be a small pressure gauge, but that's just being nit picky. Any rider should be able to use this to pump their tire to adequate riding pressure with ease, at the very least until they're able to find a higher capacity, higher speed pump.I ordered this with a couple other items that qualified for free super-saver shipping. Shipping took just shy of 2 weeks, which was a bit of a let down since bike-riding season is quickly coming to a close. It was, however, a nice surprise when the items arrived at my doorstep, as the tracking number I was given had not even been updated beyond \"we have received notice to expect this shipment...\" by the time it arrived. But that's more a review of USPS than the product lol.\n",

      "A Link to Modern Egyptology | Nina Burleigh's, Mirage: Napoleon's Scientists and the Unveiling of Egypt (HarperCollins, 2007) is a historical non-fiction book about Napoleon's occupation of Egypt.  That campaign in 1798 is among history's more memorable military fiascos.  Napoleon himself beat a retreat back to France after just a year, but his troops remained as uneasy and unwilling occupiers in an exploratory expedition gone wrong, a situation that we are told by the historian Juan Cole in an article in The Nation, that is parallel with our current situation in Iraq.  Most readers were intrigued by the excellent link provided by this book between the decaying ruins of an ancient civilization and the birth of modern Egyptology.  It is clear that anyone with an interest in or fascination with Egypt, will enjoy this book.\n",

      "Roars to life! | You should know that I absolutely adore James Cagney and will consider him one of the greatest actors of any generation for as long as I am alive.  The man was spectacular, and while he certainly had his niche, he brought too much to it over his fantastic career.  Cagney was one of the greats, a man who could really evoke such raw and authenticated emotions with nearly every character he took on.  While he played roles that could lead him to be type-casted, he always made each performance stand on its own; giving a deserved life and uniqueness to characters that, on paper, could seem almost too similar.Case in point; `The Roaring Twenties'.The film follows the tragic eventualities of World War I soldier Eddie Bartlett.  Upon returning home from the war, Eddie found that picking up where he left off wasn't so easy to do.  The current state of the economy made it nearly impossible for him to find a steady, well-paying job, and with the rent due he was bound to be homeless and desperate very soon.  So, with nowhere else to turn, Bartlett gets wrapped up in bootleg liquor and other illegal activities that slowly (but steadily) drive him to the brink.  In the mix is a young love interest who stole Bartlett's heart through letters overseas, as well as a fellow bootlegger, Panama Smith, who finds herself falling for a man who has ignorant eyes for another.  And still, shaded even more, the bonus of a purely evil Humphrey Bogart finds `The Roaring Twenties' truly `roaring'.I had an issue with the film's insistence on a documentarian feel, with newsreel announcements that took away from the authentic feel the actors brought to the film.  It just derailed the film at parts, for me at least.  Some of the stereotypical plot turns took away from what this film `could have been', and at times it became a little too soap operatic in its character approach, but despite sketchy areas in the script, the actors as a whole brought so much realism to the roles that you eat up every word and action.James Cagney is at his best here, but he is aided immensely by a stellar supporting cast that includes Bogart (an actor I never felt showed much range but who certainly lived in the genre he helped make famous) as well as an effecting Gladys George and a beautiful Priscilla Lane.The production and direction is slick and perfectly paced, and the acting is on par with the greats from that year (yes, this is another classic from 1939). In fact, Cagney should have been Oscar nominated in my opinion, and possibly even Gladys George!  If you are a fan of the genre of Cagney then this is a must see film you most certainly will appreciate.\n",

This one had to many things going on at one time, it was almost like trying to read five or six different stories at the same time. There would be a chapter about Marta, then one about the jury, then one about City Hall, then one about Steere, then one about Judy and Mary, then she would start over again with Marta. The material on Marta at the beach house of Steere was a joke, I know it is fiction but for Marta to do what she did in that much cold and snow is so far out it is unreal.
